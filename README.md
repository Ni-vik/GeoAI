We have utilized the Prithvi-100M model for the task of analyzing forest cover change. The model has a U-Net autoencoder implementation to create binary segmentation of the satellite images into forested and non-forested areas. This would enable tracking of deforestation changes and forecast of future possibilities. In our approach we have collected appropriate geospatial data, fine-tuned the model for our application, and analyzed the image masks.
